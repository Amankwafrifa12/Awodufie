            <h2>Rainbow Business Directory</h2>
            <p>
                The Rainbow Business Directory is a decolonial and trans-led collective established in 2023 to fill an
                identified need
                gap following Ghanaâ€™s LGBTIQ Strategic Consortium economic impact assessment recommendation on fostering
                an inclusive
                entrepreneurial ecosystem, enhancing economic opportunities that exist for members of especially trans
                and LGBQ+
                community, and promoting the visibility and patronage of LGBTIQ owned businesses in Ghana.
            </p>
            <br>
            <p>Our vision is to see a proactive trans population with skills for positive change in our societies. We
                are working to
                ensure a society that celebrates diversity, acknowledges the dignity of marginalized and vulnerable
                populations, and
                embraces full human rights for all people.
